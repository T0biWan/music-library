[Comgy](https://comgy.io/en/) Coding Challenge: Frontend &amp; API

The goal was to write a frontend web app that allows search through a music library and offers a rich and modern UI/UX.
iTunes was suggested for the library search functionality, since it does not require any API key or similar.

I used Nuxt, Axios and TailwindCSS to complete the coding challenge.
